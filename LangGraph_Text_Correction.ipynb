It\\'s great to meet you.\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n\\n1. **Added a more formal greeting**: Instead of \"Hello\", I used \"Hi\" to make the greeting more informal and friendly.\\n2. **Added a question to show interest**: I added \"how are you?\" to show interest in the other person\\'s well-being and to start a conversation.\\n3. **Used a more formal verb form**: I used \"doing\" instead of \"doin\" to make the verb form more standard and formal.\\n4. **Used the correct phrase**: I used \"Nice to meet you\" instead of \"Nice too met you\" to make the phrase more grammatically correct and idiomatic.\\n5. **Added a polite expression**: I added \"thanks\" to make the sentence more polite and friendly.\\n6. **Used a more formal closing**: I used \"It\\'s great to meet you\" instead of \"Nice to meet you\" to make the sentence more formal and polite.\\n\\nNote: The improved text is written in a more formal and polite tone, but it\\'s still friendly and conversational.
